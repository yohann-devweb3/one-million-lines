# Project : One Million Lines

Making of a responsive onepage site using 4 models in PNG format.

## Minimum specifications 


The HTML template contains several parts in order:

* a navigation bar,

* a jumbotron with the id 'home', containing the first part and its content,

* a section with the id 'who', containing the second part and its content,

* a section with the id 'get-involved', containing the third part and its content,

* a footer,

* a div with the id 'back-to-top' and containing the arrow to go back to the jumbotron.

The site must be responsive. We had to to resize/replace some things. See screenshot-max1199.png, screenshot-max991.png and screenshot-max767.png

For smartphone display (max-width: 767px), your navigation bar should only display the logo and an icon to access the menu.

To display icons that are not shown in images, you use Font Awesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) which is already built into the project.

```  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Slab&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">```

**Done** :
